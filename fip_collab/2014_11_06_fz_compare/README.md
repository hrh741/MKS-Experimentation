## STUDY 1

In this study I compare the L=4 results of Dipen's versus Yuksel's GSH codes.
Each uses microstructures with the same euler angles at the same voxels, however different GSH formulations are used for each.

The euler angles were randomly selected from an equal discretization of the phi2 = 0 face of the Hexagonal - Triclinic fundamental zone.
