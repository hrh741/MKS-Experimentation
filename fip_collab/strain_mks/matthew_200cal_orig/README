This folder contains results of Matthew Priddy's CPFEM simulations, and MKS analyses by Noah Paulson

Calibration: 200 trials with 7 steps each, a total of 1400 simulations. These are completely
random microstructures with random orientations picked from Bunge Euler space.

Calibration: 5 trials with 7 steps each, a total of 35 simulations. These are completely
random microstructures with random orientations picked from Bunge Euler space.


The deformation in the CPFEM simulations was strain controlled (macroscopically). The following steps
each had a unique associated simulation:
# step 00: zero macroscopic strain
# step 01: positive macroscopic strain
# step 02: negative macroscopic strain
# step 03: positive macroscopic strain
# step 04: negative macroscopic strain
# step 05: positive macroscopic strain
# step 06: negative macroscopic strain


The data files are in the VTK format and contain the following information:
# The dimensions of dataset
# The locations of the voxels
# element numbers
# Bunge Euler angles for each element
# The FIP value for each voxel
# The stress tensor in each voxel in sample coordinates
# The total strain tensor in each voxel in sample coordinates
# The plastic strain tensor in each voxel in sample coordinates

Calibrations were performed for the calculated E11 elastic strain components for steps 01 and 06 
as well as the E11 total strain component for step 06. The results were not as good as anticipated.
The next step was to run a calibration were the orientations were picked from faces of the
hexagonal fundamental zone (0<=phi1<=360, 0<=Phi<=90, 0<=phi2<=60).
