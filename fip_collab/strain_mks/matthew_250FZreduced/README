This folder contains results of Matthew Priddy's CPFEM simulations, and MKS analyses by Noah Paulson

Calibration: 250 trials with 7 steps each, a total of 1750 simulations. These are completely
random microstructures with random orientations picked from the phi2=0 face,
(0<=phi1<=360, 0<=Phi<=90, 0<=phi2<=60), of the hexagonal fundamental zone in Bunge Euler space.

Validation: 50 trials with 7 steps each, a total of 50 simulations. These are completely
random microstructures with random orientations picked from Bunge Euler space.


The deformation in the CPFEM simulations was strain controlled (macroscopically). The following steps
each had a unique associated simulation:
# step 00: zero macroscopic strain
# step 01: positive macroscopic strain
# step 02: negative macroscopic strain
# step 03: positive macroscopic strain
# step 04: negative macroscopic strain
# step 05: positive macroscopic strain
# step 06: negative macroscopic strain


The data files are in the VTK format and contain the following information:
# The dimensions of dataset
# The locations of the voxels
# element numbers
# Bunge Euler angles for each element
# The FIP value for each voxel
# The stress tensor in each voxel in sample coordinates
# The total strain tensor in each voxel in sample coordinates
# The plastic strain tensor in each voxel in sample coordinates



Calibrations were performed on the E11 strain component (elastic + plastic) for steps 1 and 6.

The results were not as good as desired with MASE around 1% and max error around 15% on average.
These simulations were run using boundary conditions from Dr.McDowell's group. We speculate that by using the
periodic boundary conditions from Dr. Kalidindi's group these results might give errors approaching
that of purely elastic simulations.
