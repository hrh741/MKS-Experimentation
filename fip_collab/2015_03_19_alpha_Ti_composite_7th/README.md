* # elements per side of MVE: 21
* microstructures generated in DREAM.3D by Matthew Priddy
* phases randomly assigned to grains in original microstructure


## PHASE 1 Properties

* Young's Modulus (E) = 115 GPA
* Yield Strength = 800 MPa
* strain to yield = 0.696% SA
* elastic, perfectly-plastic behavior

## PHASE 2 Properties

* Young's Modulus (E) = 145 GPA
* Yield Strength = 1200 MPa
* strain to yield = 0.828% SA
* elastic, perfectly-plastic behavior

Applied Strain: 0.814% SA

Boundary Conditions: periodic for uniaxial stress

* Sides of MVE free to contract
* NOTE: this is not a good BC for the MKS because it means that there will be no average value of strain for strain components other than the applied component
